        <h1>GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS</h1>
        <div id="map"></div>

        <p><b>Greenhouse gases (GHGs)</b> are gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse effect and global warming. The most prevalent GHGs include <i>carbon dioxide (CO₂)</i>, <i>methane (CH₄)</i>, <i>nitrous oxide (N₂O)</i>, and <i>fluorinated gases</i>. These emissions primarily result from human activities.
        Some of the <b>Middle East’s largest oil producing countries</b>, including Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia are among the world’s <b>largest carbon dioxide (CO₂) emitters per capita</b>. </p>

            <p>Overall, these charts illustrate that the <b>agriculture</b> sector is a significant source of <b> both methane and nitrous oxide emissions</b>, while <b>electricity and heat generation</b> remains the largest contributor to <b>CO₂ emissions</b>. 
                This information underscores the importance of targeted strategies in specific sectors to effectively mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Efforts to transition to renewable energy, improve agricultural practices, and enhance waste management will be essential in reducing overall emissions and addressing climate change.</p>

        <p>This chart illustrates the relative composition of <b>greenhouse gas emissions</b> from <b class="co2">carbon dioxide (CO₂)</b>, <b class="ch4">methane (CH₄)</b>, and <b class="n2o">nitrous oxide (N₂O)</b> between <b>1950 to 2022</b>. 
            Throughout this period, CO₂ has consistently been the <b>largest contributor</b> to emissions, accounting for approximately <b>70%</b> of the total. 
            Methane emissions have remained stable at around <b>20-25%</b>, while Nitrous Oxide has constituted a smaller share, fluctuating between <b>5-10%</b>. 
            Overall, there has been <b>little change</b> in the composition of greenhouse gases, with <b class="co2">CO₂</b><b> continuing to dominate</b>.</p>

            <p><b>Global Warming Potential (GWP)</b> is a measure used to compare the ability of different greenhouse gases to <b>trap heat</b> in the Earth's atmosphere. 
                <b>The higher</b> the GWP, <b>the more heat</b> a gas traps in the atmosphere per unit mass compared to CO₂.</p>
            <p><b>Nitrous oxide (N₂O)</b> is one of the most potent greenhouse gases, even though it is emitted in much smaller quantities compared to carbon dioxide (CO₂) and methane (CH₄), as we have seen in the previous stacked area chart. 
                It has a <b>Global Warming Potential (GWP-100)</b> of <b>273</b>, meaning that over 100 years, <b>one molecule of N₂O is 273 times more effective</b> at trapping heat in the atmosphere than <b>a molecule of CO₂</b>.</p>
