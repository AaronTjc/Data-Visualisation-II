        <h1>GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS</h1>
        <div id="map"></div>

        <p><b>Greenhouse gases (GHGs)</b> are gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse effect and global warming. The most prevalent GHGs include <i>carbon dioxide (CO₂)</i>, <i>methane (CH₄)</i>, <i>nitrous oxide (N₂O)</i>, and <i>fluorinated gases</i>. These emissions primarily result from human activities.
        Some of the <b>Middle East’s largest oil producing countries</b>, including Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia are among the world’s <b>largest carbon dioxide (CO₂) emitters per capita</b>. </p>

        <p>This chart illustrates the relative composition of <b>greenhouse gas emissions</b> from <b class="co2">carbon dioxide (CO₂)</b>, <b class="ch4">methane (CH₄)</b>, and <b class="n2o">nitrous oxide (N₂O)</b> between <b>1950 to 2022</b>. 
            Throughout this period, CO₂ has consistently been the <b>largest contributor</b> to emissions, accounting for approximately <b>70%</b> of the total. 
            Methane emissions have remained stable at around <b>20-25%</b>, while Nitrous Oxide has constituted a smaller share, fluctuating between <b>5-10%</b>. 
            Overall, there has been <b>little change</b> in the composition of greenhouse gases, with <b class="co2">CO₂</b><b> continuing to dominate</b>.</p>

        <p>Overall, these charts illustrate that the <b>agriculture</b> sector is a significant source of <b> both methane and nitrous oxide emissions</b>, while <b>electricity and heat generation</b> remains the largest contributor to <b>CO₂ emissions</b>. 
            This information underscores the importance of targeted strategies in specific sectors to effectively mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Efforts to transition to renewable energy, improve agricultural practices, and enhance waste management will be essential in reducing overall emissions and addressing climate change.</p>

        <p>This chart emphasizes that while <b>carbon dioxide</b> is the <b>most abundant greenhouse gas</b>, <b>methane and nitrous oxide</b> are much more efficient at <b>trapping heat</b>. 
            Despite being present in smaller quantities, these gases can <b>significantly accelerate global warming</b> if their emissions are not controlled. 
            Targeting <b>methane</b>, in particular, could lead to faster reductions in warming due to its <b>shorter atmospheric lifespan</b>.</p>
